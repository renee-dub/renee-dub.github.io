        <ul>
          <li>
            Pseudocode:
            <p>
              I understand and see the benefit of this technique, I haven't had
              much practice with this though, so I am going to make an effort
              and see how it helps.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Trying something:
            <p>
              This is my go-to problem-solving technique. I like to try
              different methods and ways to solve a coding challenge, and see
              what happens. I find this can be a long-winded technique if you
              are just blindly typing bits of code and seeing what happens but I
              find it's a great way to get started and test what you have just
              learnt.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Rubber ducky method:
            <p>
              I am confident using this technique, although it isn't my go-to. I
              agree that when you talk a problem through, either with others or
              an inanimate object, the answer sometimes just appears! This is a
              technique I would like to put into practice more.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reading error messages:
            <p>
              I am not super confident using this technique yet but I am slowly
              learning to understand how error messages can help and what they
              are actually trying to tell me. I like that in VS Code error
              messages let you know exactly where an issue is, it's just
              becoming more confident with understanding what information is
              being given that I need to work on.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Console.logging:
            <p>
              This would be one of my go-to problem-solving techniques. It is
              nice and easy to console log a function or statement to see if it
              has worked as you had hoped.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Googling:
            <p>
              My first-stop-shop is googling a problem. I like that there is a
              wealth of information on the world-wide-web just waiting to be
              discovered. I am getting more and more confident with this
              technique. It is sifting through the options to find an article
              that you understand that takes the most time. But it makes for
              great practice trying out the possible answers or trying to
              understand these to figure out if it will work for your particular
              problem.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking your peers for help:
            <p>
              Asking my peers for help is not one of my strong points and is an
              area that I know I need to work on during this course. I don't
              have a lot of confidence in asking for help as I always think I
              won't be understood, or people will think I'm stupid for asking
              something and this really holds me back. I will work on this as I
              know it will be hugely beneficial and great practice for when I am
              in a tech role later this year!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Asking coaches for help:
            <p>
              Again. I am not comfortable asking my coaches for help even though
              I know that is what they are here for and are only too happy to
              help! I get quite anxious as I don't want to be seen as stupid or
              feel like I am taking up someones time. This is another
              probelm-solving technique that I can see is hugely beneficial to
              my learning so I want to work on being brave and asking for help
              from the facilitators if I need it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving your process with reflection:
            <p>
              I am pretty confident with this technique as it gives you some
              time and space to think about how your day, or an area of learning
              has gone, and whether or not you need to dive deeper or ask for
              help. Making this a daily habit has been great and I now feel
              anxious if I haven't reflected on a process or learning outcome.
              The further into this course I go, I know that this will become
              even more valuable for me to solidify my learnings and identify
              areas where I need to focus more.
            </p>

        <h3>
          Reflection: a time I was reluctant to ask for help. What made me
          reluctant to do so?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I struggle with asking for help ALL THE TIME. It doesn't matter what
          the situation is, or who I am with, I struggle to vocalise and let
          people know I want to ask for help. This is an area that I would like
          to work on during bootcamp as I know this holds me back from learning
          and growing into my potential. I am always worried that the question I
          ask will be silly, or that I won't be understood, or that when I do
          get an answer after asking for help, I still won't understand what I
          need to do. I ðŸ’¯ know that none of these things matter or are true,
          this is something I need to work through to gain some confidence in
          this area.

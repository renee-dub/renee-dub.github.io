    <h1><em>My Learning Plan</em></h1>
    <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I am interested in data and how it can be used to present information in a
      visual way that is accessible to everyone. It can tell a story and help
      guide decision-making. I am also interested in the security / privacy
      aspects around data and how systems can have these functions built-in to
      keep sensitive data safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am open to seeing where learning how to code will take me. My main focus
      is finding an employer who value and look after their staff for real and
      where you feel like you are contributing and have accomplished goals each
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have an interest in Cyber Security so this course may well lead to
      further study in this area.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning.
    </h3>
    <p>Strengths: Detail orientated. Curious. Perfectionist.</p>
    <p>
      Limitations: Procrastination. Not asking for help when I really should.
      Indecisive. Lack of self-confidence.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Critical thinking. Problem solving. The ability to formulate clear and
      concise questions and answers. Self confidence.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives.
        </li>
        <p>
          I will show up when I say I will show up. I will offer help in Discord
          etc if I feel I can. If I am tasked with a particular job I will make
          sure I follow through and produce meaningful work. I will take onboard
          feedback (both positive and constructive) with kindness and work to
          improve in all areas.
        </p>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you.
        </li>
        <p>
          I will take a breath and take a break. If needed, I will reach out to
          my cohort and facilitators for help. I will be kind to myself and
          others, and remember that I am learning, bootcamp is an intense
          environment and I can do whatever I set my mind to.
        </p>
      </ul>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h3>
    <p>
      If I am stuck on a task or section of learning for more than 1 hour and
      haven’t made any progress, I will formulate a clear and concise question
      in Discord. If I still cannot find the answer, I will reach out to the
      Facilitators.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will also help myself by working through each task in chronological
      order where necessary. I have found early on that skipping ahead does not
      help!
    </p>
    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      Honest feedback. Integrity. Prompt answers to questions. Guidance. A sense
      of humour.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I don't have regular commitments that will take place during 9-5pm hours.
      Every second week I will pick up my niece from school around 3pm but this
      does not happen every day and takes 30 minutes max.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will block out time for daily mindfulness and use my lunch break to
      exercise or at least go for a walk and get some fresh air! Having time
      away from my screen will help me to reset and refresh after spending the
      morning learning.

        <h1><em>My Learning Plan</em></h1>
        <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I am interested in data and how it can be used to present information
          in a visual way that is accessible to everyone. It can tell a story
          and help guide decision-making. I am also interested in the security /
          privacy aspects around data and how systems can have these functions
          built-in to keep sensitive data safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am open to seeing where learning how to code will take me. My main
          focus is finding an employer who value and look after their staff for
          real and where you feel like you are contributing and have
          accomplished goals each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have an interest in Cyber Security so this course may well lead
          to further study in this area.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </h3>
        <p>Strengths: Detail orientated. Curious. Perfectionist.</p>
        <p>
          Limitations: Procrastination. Not asking for help when I really
          should. Indecisive. Lack of self-confidence.
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Critical thinking. Problem solving. The ability to formulate clear and
          concise questions and answers. Self confidence.
        </p>
        <h3>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme. This should include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
              productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
              industry/community representatives.
            </li>
            <p>
              I will show up when I say I will show up. I will offer help in
              Discord etc if I feel I can. If I am tasked with a particular job
              I will make sure I follow through and produce meaningful work. I
              will take onboard feedback (both positive and constructive) with
              kindness and work to improve in all areas.
            </p>
            <li>
              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
              to you.
            </li>
            <p>
              I will take a breath and take a break. If needed, I will reach out
              to my cohort and facilitators for help. I will be kind to myself
              and others, and remember that I am learning, bootcamp is an
              intense environment and I can do whatever I set my mind to.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way.
        </h3>
        <p>
          If I am stuck on a task or section of learning for more than 1 hour
          and haven‚Äôt made any progress, I will formulate a clear and concise
          question in Discord. If I still cannot find the answer, I will reach
          out to the Facilitators.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also help myself by working through each task in chronological
          order where necessary. I have found early on that skipping ahead does
          not help!
        </p>
        <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          Honest feedback. Integrity. Prompt answers to questions. Guidance. A
          sense of humour.
        </p>
        <h3>
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I don't have regular commitments that will take place during 9-5pm
          hours. Every second week I will pick up my niece from school around
          3pm but this does not happen every day and takes 30 minutes max.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will block out time for daily mindfulness and use my lunch break to
          exercise or at least go for a walk and get some fresh air! Having time
          away from my screen will help me to reset and refresh after spending
          the morning learning.

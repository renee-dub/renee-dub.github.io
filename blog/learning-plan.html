    <h1><em>My Learning Plan</em></h1>
    <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I am interested in data and how it can be used to present information in a
      visual way that is accessible to everyone. It can tell a story and help
      guide decision-making. I am also interested in the security / privacy
      aspects around data and how systems can have these functions built-in to
      keep sensitive data safe.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
      learning.
    </h3>
    <p>Strengths: Detail orientated. Curious. Perfectionist.</p>
    <p>
      Limitations: Procrastination. Not asking for help when I really should.
      Indecisive.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Critical thinking. Problem solving. The ability to formulate clear and
      concise questions, and answers.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      This should include: o An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
      work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives o What you will do when things are
      building up and starting to get to you
    </h3>
    <p>
      5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way If
      I am stuck on a task or section of learning for more than 1 hour and
      haven’t made any progress, I will formulate a clear and concise question
      in Discord.
    </p>
    <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      Honest feedback. Integrity. Prompt answers to questions. Guidance. A sense
      of humour.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
      committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments
      like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

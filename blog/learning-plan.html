        <h1><em>My Learning Plan</em></h1>
        <h2>Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          üßÅ My career aspirations are still much the same as they were during
          Foundations. I love data and want to know more about Cyber Security so
          I plan to do more study in this area once I have completed
          Bootcamp.<br />
          üßÅ Strengths: Detail orientated. Curious. Perfectionist. I don‚Äôt give
          up! Limitations: Procrastination. Not asking for help when I really
          should. Indecisive. My strengths and limitations are much the same. I
          am curious and detail-orientated but still procrastinate and am unsure
          how to form helpful questions when I am stuck. I will be focusing on
          this during Bootcamp as it‚Äôs an area that I want to improve on and
          will be a huge help if I am to go onto further study. I would add to
          my strengths that I don‚Äôt give up, no matter how long or how
          challenging I find something, I always keep going. There may be stops
          and starts along the way but I am able to jump back in and give it
          another try.<br />
          üßÅ For me it will be speaking in front of the group! I am a very
          nervous speaker at the best of times and always managed to get out of
          speeches while at high school. So I want to learn some techniques to
          get on top of this as I know speaking in front of people is a must in
          both further study and the work place. I know my focus will come and
          go, this is normal for me. I need to be conscious that this is a
          short, intense period of study where I can‚Äôt afford to do that so I
          want to learn some techniques to help me with this.<br />
          üßÅ Critical thinking. Problem solving. The ability to formulate clear
          and concise questions, and answers. I would definitely like to focus
          on problem solving algorithmically as I have struggled with this
          during Foundations.<br />
          üßÅ Honest feedback. Integrity. Prompt answers to questions. Guidance.
          A sense of humour. Communication. The same as I expected (and
          received) during Foundations.<br />
          üßÅ I will reflect on my day and plan the next day‚Äôs work before
          logging off each night. I will ask questions via Discord, and my peers
          and facilitators when needed. I will try to answer questions my peers
          may have if I am able to, and share resources that I have found
          helpful. I will make sure I am working from 9-5 each day and if extra
          time is required, make time for that.
        </p>
        <h2>Foundations</h2>
        <h3>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          I am interested in data and how it can be used to present information
          in a visual way that is accessible to everyone. It can tell a story
          and help guide decision-making. I am also interested in the security /
          privacy aspects around data and how systems can have these functions
          built-in to keep sensitive data safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am open to seeing where learning how to code will take me. My main
          focus is finding an employer who value and look after their staff for
          real and where you feel like you are contributing and have
          accomplished goals each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have an interest in Cyber Security so this course may well lead
          to further study in this area.
        </p>
        <h3>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </h3>
        <p>Strengths: Detail orientated. Curious. Perfectionist.</p>
        <p>
          Limitations: Procrastination. Not asking for help when I really
          should. Indecisive. Lack of self-confidence.
        </p>
        <h3>
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Critical thinking. Problem solving. The ability to formulate clear and
          concise questions and answers. Self confidence.
        </p>
        <h3>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme. This should include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
              productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
              industry/community representatives.
            </li>
            <p>
              I will show up when I say I will show up. I will offer help in
              Discord etc if I feel I can. If I am tasked with a particular job
              I will make sure I follow through and produce meaningful work. I
              will take onboard feedback (both positive and constructive) with
              kindness and work to improve in all areas.
            </p>
            <li>
              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get
              to you.
            </li>
            <p>
              I will take a breath and take a break. If needed, I will reach out
              to my cohort and facilitators for help. I will be kind to myself
              and others, and remember that I am learning, bootcamp is an
              intense environment and I can do whatever I set my mind to.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </h3>
        <h3>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way.
        </h3>
        <p>
          If I am stuck on a task or section of learning for more than 1 hour
          and haven‚Äôt made any progress, I will formulate a clear and concise
          question in Discord. If I still cannot find the answer, I will reach
          out to the Facilitators.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also help myself by working through each task in chronological
          order where necessary. I have found early on that skipping ahead does
          not help!
        </p>
        <h3>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          Honest feedback. Integrity. Prompt answers to questions. Guidance. A
          sense of humour.
        </p>
        <h3>
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I don't have regular commitments that will take place during 9-5pm
          hours. Every second week I will pick up my niece from school around
          3pm but this does not happen every day and takes 30 minutes max.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will block out time for daily mindfulness and use my lunch break to
          exercise or at least go for a walk and get some fresh air! Having time
          away from my screen will help me to reset and refresh after spending
          the morning learning.

        <h1><em>My Identity and Values</em></h1>
        <h3>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning
          and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Strengths: curious, perfectionist, detail-orientated.<br />My curious
          and detail-orientated nature will help me to deep dive into the
          curriculum and learn all I can. I want to know how things work, I want
          to know why, and these traits definitely help with that! These will
          help me to learn new concepts and speed up my learning process and
          introduce me to things that I haven't even heard of yet, and
          potentially gain a new skillset that will help me to secure a job once
          the course has finished while still continuing to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limitations: procrastination, lack of self-confidence, not asking for
          help when I really should.<br />I have already noticed that putting
          tasks off, or skipping ahead if a particular task seems to daunting or
          not asking for help has negative effects on my learning. It becomes
          harder to go back and attempt a task and then circle back to where
          you're supposed to be which is very confusing and doesn't help with
          procrastinating or feeling confident in my abilities. I want to be
          able to confront my fear of doing something wrong or not knowing
          something head-on and jump straight in and be curious.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and manage your own
          emotions, and the emotions of others.
        </p>

          How is Emotional Intelligence Different to Intellectual Intelligence?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and manage your
          own, and others, emotions, and change them accordingly, while
          Intellectual intelligence is your ability to learn and problem solve
          using logic and reason.

        <h3>Why is Emotional Intelligence Important?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is important as being able to understand where
          someone is coming from, why they are feeling a particular emotion, and
          the ability to build rapport with them makes working together much
          easier. People feel more at ease in group situations and more
          comfortable being themselves and asking questions when they feel seen
          and heard and understood.

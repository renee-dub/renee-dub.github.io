        <h1><em>JS Fundamentals</em></h1>
        <h3>How is JS related to HTML and CSS?</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine HTML is the skeleton. It forms the structure of your webpage.
          Then imagine CSS is the outer body, making your page look how it
          should, adding the visual elements to make it stand out, such as eye
          and hair colour. Then imagine Javascript as the muscles and heart,
          controlling your movements and keeping your blood pumping around your
          body and making sure you carry out your daily functions as a human
          being... and webpage!

        <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
        <p>
          Control Flow in Javascript is how your computer runs code from top to
          bottom. Generally code is read from top line to bottom line unless
          there is a loop, function or conditional statement that changes the
          order of the flow as new insutructions need to be carried out before
          the original code can continue to flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of this in terms of an everyday task such as feeding the dog.
          First, you got to the cupboard, get out the dog food, put the food in
          the dogs bowl (while giving him a pat for being the goodest boy!),
          tell him he can eat and then open the cupboard again to put the food
          away. Normally there wouldn't be any change to this sequence. Unless
          you go to the cupboard and there isn't any dog food! Then a loop would
          come into play as you'd need to add another set of instructions to
          purchase more dog food. Once you have completed this loop (brought
          more dog food) then you can continue in the sequence or 'control
          flow'.

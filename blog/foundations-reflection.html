              That I can learn something new, even if I have pre-conceived ideas

            <li>
              That I approach new learnings with curiosity but also resistance
              due to my lack of self-confidence. I just need to work on letting
              curiosity win!

            Being true to yourself while also being empathetic and understanding
            of others is a huge part of navigating the real world. Being able to
            collaborate and communicate with others is a skill that can be
            overlooked in more technical roles but it is so important to ensure
            yourself and your peers are happy and able to positively and
            constructively work through any challenging situations. Being aware
            of yourself, how you react to certain situations or where your
            strengths and skills lie are great tools to help guide you to what
            you need to focus on while learning, how you learn and how to ask
            for help in a way that is conducive to your learning style.

          <h3>
            <em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            That our brains are malleable and we can build new neural pathways
            and change our lives whenever we out our minds to it! I definitely
            came into this course of study scared that my age and life
            experiences wouldnâ€™t be enough to serve me well during this, but
            they have and they will.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <em
              >What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            For me it has been identifying aspects of myself that I perhaps need
            to work on. I find it very difficult to try to understand an unpack
            what is going on in my head so answering the more personal questions
            have been a challenge for me. Trying to identify my values and
            identity as I try not to think about myself so deeply most of the
            time.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <em
              >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
              course?</em
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            Because soft skills are important in the real world. It is all good
            knowing how to code but if you canâ€™t collaborate or empathise with
            others in the workplace, what good is your coding knowledge? For me
            also, having the knowledge now that I can build new neural pathways
            and change my brain by learning new skills is fantastic. I knew our
            brains were very malleable but didnâ€™t realise this applied to
            learning as well.
          </p>
          <h3>
            <em
              >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
              waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
              programming instead?</em
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            No. It is both interesting and helpful. Having time to learn how our
            brains work or reflecting on what and how we have learnt each day
            has opened my eyes to the very real possibility that I can have a
            successful career in tech. It is hugely beneficial to be learning
            how to code and learning about soft skills at the same time as this
            will better prepare us for working in tech in the real world. We
            will be not only using our technical skills but collaborating with
            others who may have very different perspectives to ours and we will
            also still be learning so having the knowledge and growth mindset
            and empathy to work alongside others will really set us up for
            success.

        <h1><em>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</em></h1>
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>What are the benefits of neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          When people are aware that their brain is in fact malleable and you
          can work to both maintain and create neural pathways, trying something
          new whether a hobby or study, seems less daunting and more achievable.
          Your ability to learn new things increases, you can solidify what you
          already know, it allows you to be resilient and recover from setbacks
          more easily and your passion for learning new things increases.
        </p>
        <h3>How can you engage with these benefits?</h3>
        <p>
          For me, I have found that my curiosity wins each time I am stuck or
          struggling with a new concept, when I remember that I can change the
          way I think and build new connections in my brain by practicing,
          practicing, practicing and visualising myself doing the task. I like
          to visualise the neurons firing to make new pathways and connections
          in my brain and try to have an open mind to what I am learning and
          remind myself that this is a new subject and it will take time to
          change my brain… for the better.
        </p>
        <h3>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🥋 Practice, practice, practice!</li>
          <li>👀 Visualise yourself completing a task before trying it out.</li>
          <li>❓ Ask questions when you are stuck.</li>
          <li>
            🗺 Do something that you already know how to do, but approach it in a
            new way.
          </li>
          <li>💃 Take up a new hobby or study something new (like coding!)</li>
          <li>
            👫 Meet new people and socialise more to expand your mindset on
            diversity.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>What is growth mindset?</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is the belief that you CAN learn something new and that
          you might not be an expert on something YET, but you will be if you
          know that your brain is malleable and you are capable of changing the
          way you think and learn. When you blur the line between hard success
          and failure, you can see that if you put in the time and effort and
          are supported along the way, you can learn something new and grow your
          mindset. If you believe that you aren’t intelligent or capable of
          learning, this will most likely be the case. But if you open your mind
          to the possibility that you aren’t quite there yet, but will be, you
          really can learn whatever you put your mind to.

        <h3>What has suprised or changed for me during this exploration?</h3>
        <p>
          For me the visualisation of growing new pathways in my brain has
          really helped with my learning journey so far. I am able to take a
          step back when I hit a roadblock and remind myself that I am a
          beginner and my knowledge isn’t there yet, but it will be. It really
          takes the stress out of learning something new!
        </p>
        <h3>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h3>
        <p>
          Being open to learning new things and reminding myself that I am a
          beginner. I am new to this subject matter and even though I get
          frustrated with not picking something up straight away, if I work at
          it and develop some confidence in asking questions, I can become a
          subject matter expert by the end of this journey! Looking at each
          challenge as a chance to learn something new and push myself and be
          rewarded with that dopamine hit when my code works.

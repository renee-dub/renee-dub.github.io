      <p>Hi! 🧁 My name is Renee and I'm currently living in South Canterbury with my family after being in Australia for the last couple of years. Prior to that I lived in Otago, Canterbury and the UK. I do love to travel and experience new places and am excited to see where I’ll be heading next!

<br>My values? I value kindness above all else. We can all benefit from it, whether we are showing kindness to someone in need, or are on the receiving end when we are struggling and need a few words of encouragement. A little kindness goes a long way 💜.

<br>Why am I attending Dev Academy? I’ve had an interest in the tech industry for a while now and decided the best way to chase my tech dreams is to dive straight in and focus on learning for the next few months. I’m looking forward to all the challenges along the way, and meeting everyone! 💃
<br>This website will document my learnings so if you'd like to follow along, click on the 'Blog' link above and join me on my tech journey! 📽</p></div>
